# Molecular View of Human Anatomy: Molecular Mechanisms of Antibiotics Action and Resistance and the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](http://card.mcmaster.ca)
 
## Overview 

The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) is a bioinformatics resource for antimicrobial resistance genes, their products and associated phenotypes. With a focus on the molecular determinants of AMR, CARD is heavily used for molecular surveillance of AMR in the environment, agriculture, and clinic:
