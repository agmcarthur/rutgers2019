# Molecular View of Human Anatomy: Molecular Mechanisms of Antibiotics Action and Resistance and the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](http://card.mcmaster.ca)
 
## Overview 

The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) is a bioinformatics resource for antimicrobial resistance genes, their products and associated phenotypes. With a focus on the molecular determinants of AMR, CARD is heavily used for molecular surveillance of AMR in the environment, agriculture, and clinic:

## Lab Goals

The goals of this laboratory is to introduce the students to the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying AMR, provide a practical exposure of databases and biocuration, illustrate the power of ontologies for organizing complex biomedical information, and provide practical skills in annotation of clinical genome sequences. All analyses will be performed online at http://card.mcmaster.ca
