# Molecular View of Human Anatomy: Molecular Mechanisms of Antibiotics Action and Resistance and the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](http://card.mcmaster.ca)
 
## Overview 

The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) is a bioinformatics resource for antimicrobial resistance genes, their products and associated phenotypes. With a focus on the molecular determinants of AMR, CARD is heavily used for molecular surveillance of AMR in the environment, agriculture, and clinic:

## Lab Goals

The goals of this laboratory is to introduce students to the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying AMR, provide a practical exposure of databases and biocuration, illustrate the power of ontologies for organizing complex biomedical information, and provide practical skills in annotation of clinical genome sequences. All analyses will be performed online at http://card.mcmaster.ca

## Antibiotic Resistance Ontology

At the heart of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database is the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), a controlled vocabulary for organizing and cross-linking diverse data within CARD.

> Question #1. Browsing from the CARD home page, what are the seven major branches of the ARO?

> Question #2. How many major drug classes are represented in the ARO? These are tagged as [Drug Class] within the ARO.

> Question #3. Using the search box, find the ARO term for the MCR-1 protein. Outline what drugs MCR-1 confers resistance to and via which mechanism. Explain the mechanism by exploring the ARO terms associated with MCR-1.
